## What's this

This is a Gradle plugin for managing Gradle dependencies.

Although Gradle later launched the Version Catalogs to manage dependencies, its method is still not free and user-friendly, and has limitations.

Different from traditional dependency management methods, `SweetDependency` uses YAML for dynamic configuration,
which is relatively readable, and the configuration process is simple and easy to use.

## Compatibility

Not just Android projects, any project that uses Gradle as a build tool will work.

Currently there is only Gradle plugin, IDEA related plugins are still under development,
support for syntax checking of configuration file and displaying configuration file in the Android project's Gradle files list is expected.

Gradle `7.x.x` and `8.x.x` are supported, other versions have not been tested and are not recommended.

> Build Script Language

- Kotlin DSL

It is recommended to use this language as the build script language first, which is also the language currently recommended by Gradle.

- Groovy DSL

Some functions may be incompatible, support will be gradually dropped in the future, and some functions may become unavailable.
